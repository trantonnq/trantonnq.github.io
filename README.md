## Deep Learning - Sentiment Analysis for Amazon Product Reviews
• Classify customers’ attitudes (positive, neutral, or negative) toward a product based on their reviews with Natural Language Processing technique using PyTorch and Huggingface transformer

## [Big Data for Health - Classify Sleep Stages with Apple Watch Data](https://github.com/trantonnq/ClassifySleepStages)
- Built model to classify different sleep stages a person cycles through each night using readily available data from smart wearable devices in order to better understand their sleep quality. 
- Dataset were created by University of Michigan by collecting Apple Watch Health data and Polysomonography data of 31 subjects during their sleep.
- Engineered features from raw sampled health data including heart rate, motion, circadian, clock using interpolation and Gaussian filter
- Applied different supervised learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Net and AdaBoost and compare their performanced through metrics such as accurarcy and ROC curves.
